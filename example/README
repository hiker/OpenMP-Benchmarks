A short description of the example files:

tau-pdt-based
   The file 3nodes.ppk is based on a 3 node run, and is using pdt (part of
   tau) to modify the source to insert calls to tau. While this gives
   most flexibility, the parser can often have problem and abort.
   Use paraprof 3nodes.ppk to visualise the results

tau-compilerinstrumentation
   This file is based on using compiler based instrumentation: This is a lot
   more robust than the pdt parser included in tau, but in the past has 
   given less information. At least in this example it appears that it
   collected all subroutines and openmp statements, the only missing thing
   are the line numbers of subroutine, which are not important anyway.
   Use paraprof 3nodes-comp.ppk to visualise the results.


 Several tau packed data files can be visualised at the same time, e.g.:
 paraprof tau-compilerinstrumentation/3nodes-comp.ppk tau-pdt-based/3nodes.ppk
